## Project Sought
I am seeking a capstone project that allows me to use my strengths which are cloud computing and web development. Through many coops I have built a strong foundation and now I wish to use that to create a capstone project where I can finally put my skills to use for something that I want to do. I want to create something that I feel very passionate about. Some of my interests are frontend development using languages such as tailwind css and also doing cloud computing if necessary to create something on cloud.
