## Project Sought

I am seeking a capstone project that allows me to apply my web development skills in a meaningful way. I would like to work on a project that involves developing a full-stack web application with a focus on user experience and functionality. I am particularly interested in projects that include React JS, .NET Core, and Azure, as well as those that require UI/UX to create a polished final product. My goal is to work on a project that challenges my technical abilities and also contributes to solving real-world problems.
