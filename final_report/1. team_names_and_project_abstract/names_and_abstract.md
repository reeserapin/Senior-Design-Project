## Project Abstract

Social media app for pets - As a foster parent, I often wonder what happens to animals after they're adopted, so this platform would allow the pet’s account to transfer to the new owner while fostering families could still follow their journey. It would also help make pets more adoptable, as people could join and see photos of available animals. For breeders, the app could include a verification process to prevent scams, with ID checks and multiple pet photos. A family tree feature could track a pet’s lineage—parents, siblings, etc.—and help identify ethical breeders.
