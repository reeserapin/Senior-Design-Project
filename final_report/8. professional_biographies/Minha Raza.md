# Project Sought
I'm looking to learn something new in my capstone project. I would love to drive deeper in UX/UI Engineering. Moreover, I think web development or even app development would be super beneficial, since I have not been able to deep dive into either. I was to create some kind of app that is useful, that I am passionate about!
