**Individual Capstone Assignment**
I am really looking forward to this project. I think that my journey in Computer Science at
Cincinnati has been fruitful, and empowering, yet it would be a lie if I did not acknowledge that
it has been a huge challenge. I hope to widen my horizons with this project. Front end
development is something I have been aiming to do, but I think I need some practice to make
myself familiar with front end framework. I think my degree thus far has given me training on
how to think and breakdown large problems into tangible tasks to make something great, and that
is what I intend to do. We plan to create a web application that is social media for pets/ a place
for ethical foster homes to register and connect with users looking to adopt.
I cannot emphasize enough how academic curriculum is not as much about the material itself,
but more about HOW to think through problems. My first class that helped me do this was the
Intro to Computer Science class, which was my very first introduction to coding. It was a huge
challenge because I had never touched any code a day in my life before, and I had no sense on
how to work a technical problem. I think another class that was a defining part of my academic
career was data structures because it was foundational to not only my actual curriculum, but also
foundational to my way in approaching technical problems.
My co-ops have been extremely life changing, for lack of better words. I have been able to work
for GE Appliances for my double rotation. Being able to have two different kinds of software
engineering roles really opened my eyes at what you could do even within the same company,
even with the same job title. I really enjoyed being on Team Rocket doing User Experience for
the wall oven, and it had taught me that I really do enjoy front end development, which is
inspiration for our project being front end framework. I think my time at GE Appliances
provided me with foundational experience on jumping into a front end framework that I was not
comfortable in. This experience will be useful when jumping into a new one for this project.
I think I am excited for this project for multiple reasons in different areas. I think firstly, our idea
about incorporating an online space for pets and ethical pet fostering is something I am a big
supporter of. I am also excited to take time to learn front end, this has been on my mind for a
while, especially after my spring co-op. I think since this is a group project, we need to be super
strategic about our goals long term. I hope to discuss the goals of our web applications and
ultilize some of the UI design process we have been learning in class. After establishing these
goals, and doing some interviews and sketches, we will be able to write a breakdown of things to
do and create tickets within GitHub to split work up evenly.
I hope to have a basic working app at the end of this project. Even more so, I hope to be
confident and comfortable in front end development by the end. We will write out our goals, and
we will rank them on importance, and discuss them as we go. I think that projects can be so
dynmic and its hard to know when something is ”done.” Maybe it will never be done, but I think
when we have met the basic goals, and have something working, it will be a good indication. I
think the best way to evaluate yourself is being fully honest, but discussing with your team
openly how everyone is doing. Teammates are the ones who know best about your progress.
